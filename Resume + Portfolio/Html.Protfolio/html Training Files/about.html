    About Me
  </h1>
  <p>
    Hello, Fellow coders. My name is Sara. I was hoping to take the time to introduce myself a bit here on this page.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have wanted to code for as long as I knew what programming was, ever since I first played my first game. I have always wanted to make a difference in the world, and coding is that difference to me. I wanted to make the same kind of impact on a kids life, that some random developers made on mine. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When I was a kid, I used to collect old computers and tear them apart, just to see how they worked. How it was able to play the games on them, and how they transfered the images to the screen. I would have torn the monitors apart too, but my mom didn't want broken glass on the carpets, since both of us walked around barefoot. Lol. I do remember that at first I could tear them apart with ease, but I had no clue what each piece was which, and how to put it back together. Then I looked them up on the, then, new internet, and I learned all my childish mind could. I took in every piece of information I could find, and I was never satisfied. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Then I wondered on what made the pieces of metal do what they did, and that's how I learned that there was code involved. I was astonished, and wanted to learn some more. Unfortunantly, I understood none of the jargon at the time. So I had to be content with just pretending that I was building a game by button mashing on word. I legit thought I was coding...
  </p>
  <p>
    I miss those times where I thought anything was possible, and am just now getting that mindset back again. I feel like I can do anything that I put my mind to, and that led me back to my childhood passion, coding. Now, I'm learning on my own as fast as possible while still proccessing the information given to me. It's a lot of work, but I'm determined to do it this time. I'm determined to be a successful programer, one who is respected and well liked. I hope to be among the best eventually, though I am aware that I have a very long way to go for that to happen. 
  </p>

    I want to thank you for reading my story on how I got into the field nd thought about finally applying my love for it, and I wanted to wish you all the best in your day/night. <br>
