<h1>The Best Movies According to Sara Jade</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fire Starter</h3>
<p>This is my all time favorite film because it is also my favorite authors. This movie was first a book, and I definately wore out my copy really quick. I really love the way it was made. Prefer the older version though, not the remake.</p>
<h3>Rocky Horror Picture Show</h3>
<p>I loved how awesome it was, and the way it was made, and that fact that it had Trans people in it. Especially for the time it was released. And people still loved it! The tradgedy is that a lot of those same people hate on trans people in real life...</p>
<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Only thing I didnt like was how Bella was with Edward. </p>
